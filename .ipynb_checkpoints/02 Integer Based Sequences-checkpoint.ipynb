    "# Integer Based Sequences w/ For Loops\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "With studying Computer Science, we can use a lot of integers. By using ```range()``` function along with a ```for loop```, we can start to analyze integer based sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ```range()``` function\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```range()``` function can take 3 different arguments and it must have atleast __1 argument__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```range()``` function is a function that generates an _iterable_ sequence of integers in an arithmetic progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "__IMPORTANT NOTE:__ the result of a ```range()``` function is not printable by itself. It must be converted to string or a list if you want to see the __entire sequence__.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Different Behaviours of:__ ```range()```\n",
    "\n",
    "_NOTE: ```[:``` means inclusive, ```(:``` means exclusive_ Read more at this [link](http://zonalandeducation.com/mmts/miscellaneousMath/intervalNotation/intervalNotation.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ```range(n)``` returns a sequence of ```[0,n)```\n",
    "2. ```range(a,b)``` returns a sequence of ```[a,b)```; if a == b, it is an empty sequence\n",
    "3. ```range(start, end, interval_value)``` returns a sequence of ```[start,end)```, but the sequence will approach the end value by adding each step with the interval value. if the ```interval_value``` is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "_NOTE: ```range()``` never includes the last/ending value._\n",
    "\n",
    "__Examples of range()__\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "range(10) :: contains 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n",
    "\n",
    "range(10,21) :: contains 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20\n",
    "\n",
    "range(2, 20, 4) :: contains 2, 6, 10, 14, 18\n",
    "\n",
    "range(100, 0, -10) :: contains 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10\n",
    "\n",
    "range(-10, -15, -1) :: contains -10, -11, -12, -13, -14\n",
    "\n",
    "range(-5, 6) :: contains -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Loops with ```range()```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since ```range()``` returns an iterable sequence, we can look through each individual values in it with a ```for loop```."
